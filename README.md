ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm FerCon, a passionate backend developer fueled by coffee and clean code. I thrive on architecting robust systems and crafting efficient algorithms to power seamless user experiences.

ðŸš€ Currently, I'm diving deep into backend, leveraging node js to build scalable solutions that push boundaries and solve real-world problems.

ðŸ’» With a solid foundation in Node Js, Typescript, Phyton, PHP & JAVA, I specialize in designing RESTful APIs, optimizing database performance, and implementing security measures to safeguard sensitive data.

ðŸ”§ When I'm not immersed in lines of code, you can find me tinkering with new tech gadgets, exploring the great outdoors, or indulging in a good sci-fi novel.
